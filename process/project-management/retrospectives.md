# Retrospectives
## Iteration 1:

**Improvements to do:**
- Keep branches up to date and ready for anyone to work on them;
- Meeting daily or every x days to update each other on what is happening, difficulties found and resolve them if possible;
- Create a branch for each issue (working item);
- Create Unit and Acceptance tests.

**What went well:**
- We did a good increment;
- This iteration was great for us to get to know more how to code in dart (flutter).

## Iteration 2:

**Improvements to do:**
- All work items should be done in a separated branch, and merged into the main through pull request;
- Automatize acceptance tests and create more unit tests;
- Refactor some things so that everything is in the best way and aligned/integrated with the UNI app.

**What went well:**
- We did a very good increment;
- We close all user stories foreseen for this iteration;
- We are coding faster, and learning a lot.

## Iteration 3 (final):

**Final Resume:**
- We did a very good increment and completed all our objectives for our product;
